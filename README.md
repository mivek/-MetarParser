# MetarParser


This java lib provides a Metar and TAF decoder.

Use the MetarFacade class and its method decode to decode a metar.
Use the MetarFacade class and its method retrieveFromAirport to get the metar of an airport. This metod take the icao code as parameter.
The trends of the metar are not parsed.

## Model
The model is generated by using the Eclipse visualization tool [ObjectAid](http://www.objectaid.com/home).
When updating classes in packages com.mivek.enums or com.mivek.model, the class diagram is also updated.
When added a new class/enumeration in one of those package, drag and drop the new class to model.ucls and generate a new jpeg of the class diagram.

### Enumerations

The application contains numerous enumarations to represent datas.
  - CloudType: to represent the type of cloud.
  - CloudQuantity: to represent the amount of clouds.
  - Intensity: to represent the intensity of a meteorological phenomenon.
  - Descriptive: to represent the descriptive of a meteorological phenomenon.
  - Phenomenon: to represent a phenomenon.
  - WeatherChangeTime: to represent a trend.
  - TimeIndicator: to represent the time of the trend.
  
### Classes

#### Airport
The airport class is composed of
  - Name
  - City
  - Country
  - IATA code
  - ICAO code
  - latitude
  - longitude
  - altitude
  - timezone

####  Cloud
In this application a cloud is composed of 
  - CloudQuantity
  - CloudType (optional)
  - height (optional)
  
#### Country
A country is represented by its name.

#### Runway information

The runway information is composed of 
  - The name of the runway
  - The minimal visibility on the runway
  - The maximal visibility on the runway (optional)
  - The trend of the visibility (optional)

#### Visibility

The visibility class is composed of
  - The main visibility
  - The minimal visibility (optional)
  - The direction of the minimal visibility (optional)

#### WeatherCondition
The weather condition is class to represent a meteorological phenomenon.
A weather condition is composed of 
  - an intensity (optional)
  - a descriptive (optional)
  - a list of phenomenon
  
#### Wind
The wind class is composed of 
  - the speed
  - the direction
  - the speed of the gust
  - the lowest variable wind
  - the highest variable wind
  - the unit of the wind's speed

### Trends
![trends diagram](trend.jpg)
Numerous classes represents the trends. Trends are stored inside a list of the metar object `Metar.getTrends()`.
Trends are composed of 
  - a Type (BECMG or TEMPO)
  - a wind
  - a visibility and vertical visibility
  - a list of clouds
  - a list of weather conditions
  - a list of `AbstractMetarTrendTime` to represent the time with its type (AT, FM, TL)


## Examples
### Parse a metar
Instantiate the metarFacade and use its method parse.

```java
String code = "LFPG 131830Z 19005KT 170V250 9999 -SHRA FEW040TCU SCT086 16/08 Q1011";
MetarFacade facade = MetarFacade.getInstance();
Metar metar = facade.decode(code);
```

### Retrieve the metar of an airport
Instantiate the metarFacade.
Use the its method retrieveFromAirport with the ICAO code of the airport.

```java
String icao = "LFPG";
MetarFacade facade = MetarFacade.getInstance();
Metar metar = facade.retrieveFromAirport(icao);
```
### Parse a taf
Use the TAFFacade to decode the taf.

```java
String message = "TAF LFPG 150500Z 1506/1612 17005KT 6000 SCT012 \n" 
			      +"TEMPO 1506/1509 3000 BR BKN006 PROB40 \n"
			      +"TEMPO 1506/1508 0400 BCFG BKN002 PROB40 \n"
			      +"TEMPO 1512/1516 4000 -SHRA FEW030TCU BKN040 \n" 
			      +"BECMG 1520/1522 CAVOK \n"
			      +"TEMPO 1603/1608 3000 BR BKN006 PROB40 \n"
			      +"TEMPO 1604/1607 0400 BCFG BKN002 TX17/1512Z TN07/1605Z";
TAFFacade facade = TAFFacade.getInstance();
TAF taf = facade.decode(message);
```
Lines of the message have to be separated by a "\n" character.

### Retrieve a taf
Use the TAFFacade and the method retrieveFromAirport with the ICAO code of the airport.

```java
String icao = "LFPG";
TAFFacade facade = TAFFacade.getInstance();
TAF taf = facade.retrieveFromAirport(icao);
```

### Internationalization
English and french locales are supported by the library. The library uses the user's locale.
The default locale is english.

#### Change the locale
To change the locale use the method `setLocale(Locale)` of the class `Messages.java`
```(java)
Messages.getInstance().setLocale(Locale.FRENCH); // Changes the locale to french.
```
If you are willing to add a new locale please see [Contributing.md file](CONTRIBUTING.md).
